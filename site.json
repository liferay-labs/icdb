Lessons learned from building FT.com","description":"In 2016, we at The Financial Times launched a new version of our website to great success. It broke ground on key areas in which we’d set out to excel and measured very closely, like performance, resilience and usability. But one day, and rather serendipitously, we realized we had largely forgotten to measure one thing: accessibility. And you can’t improve what you don’t measure. In this talk I will go over how we went from being generally oblivious about accessibility to making it a core part of our process across multiple divisions. I will share the roadblocks we found and the lessons we learned, along with tangible solutions you can integrate them into your own project today, regardless of available time, budget or support.","speaker":"Laura Carvajal","twitter":"lc512k","video":null,"tags":["js","accessibility"],"layout":"talk","weight":2,"content":" Notes FT was very good, but when they checked, they weren't doing good on accessibility Accessibility doesn't just happen, you need to make it happen Accessibility goes beyond not denying access but making sure it is fair 1 Billion people (15%) with disabilities, but you need to adapt it to your audience.
