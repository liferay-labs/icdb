title: "How To Be A Web A/V Artist"
description: "Come and be fascinated by the world of audio visualisation in a browser. This isn’t just about creating stunning data vis to music! We see how we can pipe data realtime into custom properties to enhance our visuals. The speaker re-addresses how we analyse sound via the Web Audio API and proposes a better way of processing the data to better suit music. And, to top it all off, we harness the Web MIDI API for full hardware control as well. You may not think it, but this really is a talk with a great deal of take-aways and new techniques for you to consider in your coding life."

##### Notes

- Tons of APIs for VJs today
- The `Audio API` can create oscillators, analyze sounds and gives us an array of freq velocities.
- Use the power of the CSS and native features -> custom properties
- Data can be better, and it's not always suited for the visualization you want. You want to normalize and adapt it properly even if the API doesn't provide it
