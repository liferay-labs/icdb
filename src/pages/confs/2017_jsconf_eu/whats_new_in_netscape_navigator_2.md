title: "What's new in Netscape Navigator 2.0"
description: "How can we know how good we’ve got it without really understanding how good we used to have it? JavaScript was first released with Netscape Navigator 2.0 in September 1995 - can an application from today exist in the browsers of yesterday? Just how different was the development experience then compared to now? Is it feasible to implement a modern Web application in the browser that pioneered client-side development? What would code from 1995 look like rewritten with today’s JavaScript?"
